# Next Character Prediction using Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project implements a neural network using PyTorch to predict the next character in a given sequence of text. The model is designed to learn from patterns in the text and generate coherent sequences based on the input.

## Features
- **Text Data Preprocessing**: Efficient preparation and cleaning of text data for training.
- **Neural Network Model**: Custom neural network built with PyTorch to predict the next character in a sequence.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Processes to train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
- **Text Generation**: The ability to generate sequences of text by predicting subsequent characters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

To install the required packages, use:
```bash
pip install torch pandas matplotlib nltk
```

## Results
The model is designed to predict the next character in a sequence. By training on a text corpus, the model learns to generate text that mimics the style and structure of the input data.
