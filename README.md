# Next Character Prediction using Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project uses a neural network to predict the next character in a text sequence. It's a basic example of sequence modeling and natural language processing (NLP) using deep learning.

## Features
- **Text Data Preprocessing**
- **Neural Network Model for Sequence Prediction**
- **Training and Evaluation**
- **Text Generation**

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results
The model predicts the next character in a sequence with reasonable accuracy. Example outputs demonstrate its ability to generate coherent text.
